- The VNA_PLOTTING_MULTIMODE.py is a script that plots the data of the S21 parameter for three modes 
of the multimode resonator.

- The PPMS_VNA_PLOTTING_CONTROLLING.py is a script that controlls the ppms and plots the same information as the 
VNA_PLOTTING_MULTIMODE.py. All the information related to the control of the ppms is written in the script. 
To run this program the PPMS_VNA_AUXILIAR_SCRIPT.py has to be in the same folder. 


To run both programs the folder QDPPMSComms has to be in the same folder as the scripts.
